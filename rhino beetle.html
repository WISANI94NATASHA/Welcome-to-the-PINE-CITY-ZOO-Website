    <h3>RHINO-BEETLE</h3>
    <p>he Dynastinae are among the largest of beetles, reaching more than 15 centimetres (6 inches) in length, but are completely harmless to humans because they cannot bite or sting. Some species have been anecdotally claimed to lift up to 850 times their own weight.[3] An extinct Eocene Oryctoantiquus borealis was the largest fossil scarabeid, with a length of 5 centimetres (2.0 in).[4] Some modern Oryctini grew up to 7 cm (3 in).[4] Common names of the Dynastinae refer to the characteristic horns borne only by the males of most species in the group. Each has a horn on the head and another horn pointing forward from the center of the thorax. The horns are used in fighting other males during mating season, and for digging. The size of the horn is a good indicator of nutrition and physical health.[5]
        The body of an adult rhinoceros beetle is covered by a thick exoskeleton. A pair of thick wings lie atop another set of membranous wings underneath, allowing the rhinoceros beetle to fly, although not very efficiently owing to its large size. Their best protection from predators is their size and stature, also avoiding many due to being nocturnal. When the sun is out, they hide under logs or in vegetation to camouflage themselves from the few predators big enough to eat them. If rhinoceros beetles are disturbed, some can release very loud, hissing squeaks created by rubbing their abdomens against the ends of their wing covers.</p>
          <strong><p>WHERE TO FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>They are found in various habitats, including gardens,farms and insect house at PINE CITY ZOO and are recognized for their ability to burrow into the earth and feed on decaying matter. These beetles also play a vital role in the ecosystem by breaking down organic material and recycling nutrients. </p>
