    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p> The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival. Previously, some sources classified the related East African oryx, or beisa oryx (Oryx beisa), as a subspecies.</p>
           
    <strong><p>WHERE TO FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Gemsbok are found in arid and semi-arid bushlands in southwestern Africa, especially around the Namib and Kalahari deserts, in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa and formerly Angola (where they are considered extirpated).

        A sizeable introduced population of several thousand is also present in the Chihuahuan Desert in Southern New Mexico at the White Sands Missile Range where they are problematic for the local ecosystem. </p>
